## About myself ##

I wrote my first line of **BASIC** when I was 8 or so, thanks to my big bro who was studying Computer Science at the Modena University, on my beloved Commodore 64.

After that I started to watch at him as my grand master and started to learn about variables, logic instructions, and iteration. 

Few months later since my brother started to work I left the programming for a while and enjoyed friends and the county life in my hometown.

I re started to code again when I arrived at high school using many different languages: **PHP**, **Visual Basic**, **Pascal**, **C++**. 

In the meanwhile since I wasn’t satisfied about the school (The IT course was too easy!) I started play around using **C++** and **OpenGL**.

Was so funny when two years later I had to develop my final exam project: a video surveillance software written using Borland **C++** Builder in less than 2 weeks instead of 2 months.

It could support up to 16 cameras and also had motion detection (Thanks to the cameras libraries in bundle). I loved it!

At the university I chose to study Physics (Computational physics courses were looking so nice), and my math was so horrible after high school!

During the University I developed some projects in **FORTRAN** and a website for my Starcraft team (now only the forum still up at this address: http://www.clan-the.net/forum/). 

Ended my studies I started to work in Soft-net srl in Sassuolo, and stopped to develop my own projects, but pushed by my perfectionism I continued to study and test new technologies to make my workplace, workflows and my code better and better.

Everything else is recent history: I left my job in Italy and started to travel around Australia, worked 3 months in Rocket internet, where I successfully solved many bugs, implemented some nice feature on their e-commerce system and assisted them during the launch of (theiconic.com.au and zanui.com.au).

I had to move back in Italy since my mum had some serious health problems, there I started to work for “Be & Partners” and collaborate( again ) with “Soft-Net” .

Now luckily the problems at home are gone, so I’m back in Oz now working at Gomeeki, but looking ahead for new challenges.

Interests: Programming, Science and Technology, Snowboarding (Surf now).
