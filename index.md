**TL;DR**

Hi, my name is Alberto Tedeschi, I was born on the 7th of September 1985, I am a **software developer**, 
 during my six years of commercial experience and probably many more as amateur coder I've mastered PHP, Javascript, I am quite good in C# and fluent in many others Python, C++, Java.

 I would like to join an enthusiastic and passionate team. Fast pace environments doesn't scare me, I am flexible with the toolset used if it’s the right one for the job and I’m more than happy to learn new technologies.
 
Currently working on an online fundraising platform Gofundraise and coding a mobile geotracking system based in MVC5, MS-SQL, RethinkDb and soon hosted on Ms Azure.
